>>>>>>> Stashed changes
        <p> The digital art movement is when the art space completely shifted due to the
            development of technology. It went from plain old physical hand-made copies to
            artists using the latest forms technologies to create fully digitalized and unique pieces of art.
            Everyday, thousands of people all over the world create their own forms of digital art. 
            Digital Art incorportates all styles of art including abstract, modern, pop art, virtual reality, 3D Renders,
            and more that are all done digitally.
        </p>
        <h3> Where It All Began</h3>
        <p2> One of the first examples of digital art is done by mathmetician Benjamin Laposky, who is credited with making the first
            computer graphics, utilizing an oscilloscope to create abstract art in the 1950s.<br>
            <img style ="width: 15%" src="assets/history.jpeg" > <br>
            Throughout the 1960s, digital art was difficult to create for those who were not mathmeticians or programmers due to
            the lack of accessibility of computers. It was more in the mid 80s where artists no longer had to rely on their connections
            with scientists, mathmeticians, programmers, or university faculty to create their own digital artwork. The 1991 creation of 
            the World Wide Web was a great time for artists to come alive because more and more computers were normalized in the household. <br>
