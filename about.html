        <h2> History</h2>
            <p2>One of the first examples of digital art is done by mathmetician Benjamin Laposky, who is credited with making the first
            computer graphics, utilizing an oscilloscope to create abstract art in the 1950s. </p2> <br>

            <!--More text about history-->
            <p3> Throughout the 1960s, digital art was difficult to create for those who were not mathmeticians or programmers due to
            the lack of accessibility of computers. It was more in the mid 80s where artists no longer had to rely on their connections
            with scientists, mathmeticians, programmers, or university faculty to create their own digital artwork. The 1991 creation of 
            the World Wide Web was a great time for artists to come alive because more and more computers were normalized in the household.
